# CS2 Case Spinner Simulator Thing

## Overview

Ever wanted to spin CS2 cases but you don't have any money to burn or just wanna test your luck?

Well, heh, YOU'RE IN LUCK! This case spinning website lets you pick from a large array of different cases from really expensive ones to just the cheapest ones that you can find on the steam market place! 

## How to play

Playing the simulator is very easy, all you have to do is click buy on the case that you have selected and BOOM! You will spin the case and after the spin you will see what item you would've gotten in CS2!

## Tips and misc info

At the bottom left you can see how much money you would've spent and how much you've lost/earnt if you had done it in actual CS2! 

If you don't like your balance and want a fresh start you can click the delete data button to remove the data (or for you tech savvy dudes, you can just clear the localStorage)!

Whilst this does have the real chances of each drop from CS2, because I cannot be bothered added every single knife/glove there is a chance offset of about .43% which won't make too much of a difference but I thought I would just let you know! 

## Closing statement

Yea... I hope you enjoy and whatnot, see if you can become a millionaire or you become the person that has a greater debt than America!
